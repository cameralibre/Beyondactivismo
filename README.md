### What are we doing?

We are addressing the following problems:

1. When human rights topics are discussed in the news, often activists lack attention. Even if their struggles get worldwide attention, _they_ often
are unknown, their motives, strategies and experiences are lost.
2. Human rights activists around the world don’t have an easy tool for connecting with each other, and it is important that they can share their
experiences to empower others.
3. Collecting and distributing information is too big a task for only a couple of people.

### What is our solution?
With those problems as a starting point, we came up with an idea for a safe multilingual platform, that works as an open collaboration network between different people around the world. 

Here, on the one hand we can share verified human rights
activist’s experiences and histories in an attractive and creative way, documented by the BA Community. 

On the other hand, human rights activists can inspire, interact, collaborate and support each other.

### How do we plan to achieve this?

We are planning to achive this problems basically through three mechanisms that converge::

**1. Interviews**: We see the interviews are a way to connect. 
That is why we strongly believe that we need to know and share the histories and experiences of human rights activists
in a creative and attractive way. Because of the importance of the interviews we have always to keep on mind their purposes, which are know about:

- the background of the activists
- about their motivations
- her/is way to think and do activist
- their experiences doing activism and recommendations
- their support doing activism
- to connect the activists with our lectors, community and future interest collaborators and activists.

It is also important to say, that the improvement of the storytelling of the content of the interviews is strongly related to the achievment of our goals, so is something that we need to have always in mind when we upload the interviews.

**2. Open Platform**: As a project based on internet that has the need to expand arround the world to commite its goals,
we are working in a open platform that has in mind the following principles:

a) Opennes: Our project is thought as a open network of collaborators where they can work, give ideas, make improvements, take decisions, and so on. 
That is why we are working with open repositories where among other things our community can:

- promote ideas, projects, activist to interview, etc.  
- design and improvement of our website
- create, improve and distribute content (for example, submitt written interviews, documentary films, photographys, animations, etc) 
- create, improve and use toolkits (to facilitate the production of content about human rights activists, we are creating tools and templates to ease and standardize workflows in a safe multilingual platform, because we believe that using the internet to create a safe and healthy space, we can break different physical and non physical borders to allow everyone to benefit from this project)
- translate the content uploade by the community
- promote the re-utilization of content (BA works with Licenses where the only restriction is the recognition of authorship of the works)

b) Decentralization: Our project is thought as a global community of passionate Internet users who share our vision. They can work in our platform where we are going to use open standards to facilitate the interoperability. 

c) Digital Inclusion: We believe in a place where everybody can participate without threats to our or others reputation, confidence, or safety. Beyond Activismo is aim to be a platform where we promote and expect diversity and respect. If we could achieve to everyone is because we are achieving our goal.


**3. Community**: To achieve our goals we need to build a community of collaborators, readers, activists, sharers and so on to benefit the project from their different skills. As we said before it is a project thought as a open, decentralized and inclusive global community, that is why without a strong community this project will be never succeed. 

### Why it is exciting to take part in Beyond Activismo?
Beyond Activismo is exciting because it aims to be a global, open community of collaborators willing to share and create content about the experiences and histories of human rights activists.

Being part of Beyond Activismo is a way to make a change, inspire others, and co-work with diversely-skilled people around the world who want to spread the word, and help others to find solutions, inspiration and
friends along the way.
